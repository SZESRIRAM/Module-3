# Tuple in Python: Check Element Existence

## 🎯 Aim
To write a Python program that checks if the element `'n'` and the element `8` exist within a given tuple.

## 🧠 Algorithm
1. Define a tuple `x` with some letters and numbers.
2. Use the `in` operator to check if the string `'n'` exists within the tuple.
3. Use the `in` operator to check if the integer `8` exists within the tuple.
4. Print the results.

## 🧾 Program
```
x = ('a', 'b', 'n', 4, 6, 8)
print('n' in x)
print(8 in x)
```

## Result
Thus, the given program has been executed successfully and the existence of the elements 'n' and 8 in the tuple is verified using the in operator.
